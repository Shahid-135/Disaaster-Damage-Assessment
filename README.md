# MGLTU-Net: Multi-Representation Graph Learning with Triplet Cross-Attentive Uncertainty-Guided Network
## Abstract  

Effective disaster response relies on timely and accurate damage assessment, yet existing methods struggle with ambiguous visual cues, heterogeneous damage patterns, and modality-specific uncertainties.  
In this work, we propose a principled framework that unifies **multi-representation graph learning**, **triplet cross-attention**, and **uncertainty-guided fusion** to address these challenges.  
Our approach introduces:  
1. A **Semantic Class-Aware Graph module** for semantically grounded relational reasoning.  
2. A **Multi-Scale Triplet Cross-Attention mechanism** to capture spatial dependencies across multiple dimensions.  
3. An **Uncertainty-Weighted Fusion strategy** that ensures robust integration even under compromised modalities.  

To support further research, we also introduce **DAMAGE**, a large-scale, manually annotated benchmark for complex damage assessment. Extensive experiments on CrisisMMD and DAMAGE demonstrate that our method achieves **state-of-the-art performance**, setting a new standard for disaster damage assessment.
