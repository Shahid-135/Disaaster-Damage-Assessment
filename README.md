# MGMT-Net:Multimodal Graph-based Multi-scale Triplet Attentive Uncertainty-Guided Network
This project presents a novel framework for disaster damage assessment that combines **multi-representation graph learning**, **triplet cross-attention**, and **uncertainty-guided fusion**. Our approach captures complex semantic and spatial relationships in post-disaster imagery, achieving **state-of-the-art performance** on both CrisisMMD and our newly introduced **DAMAGE benchmark dataset**.
